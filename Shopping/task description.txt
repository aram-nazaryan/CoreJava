Write a program that processes the checkout in a supermarket.
Model a ShoppingCart using an array of ProductItem that keeps the items and counts the
Ô¨Ånal total price. When the total price is calculated, the payment should take place. Take note that
payment is a general concepts and there are special payment types such as CashPayment and
CreditCardPayment.
In your program, add some ProductItems in the store catalogue so that you can run the program
with actual command-line input. You may use the Scanner class to accept and process input.

Some of the classes that may exist in your program (complete the implementation).
class ProductItem {
// product number, unit price, name, any other useful data
}
ShoppingCart {
private ProductItem[] items; // Choose a maximum number of allowed items to simplify the program
private int[] quantity; // the quantity of n-th item in the ProductItem[] array
public void add(ProductItem item, int howMany) { ... }
public double getTotal() { ... } //
}
interface Payment() {
void accept(double amount);
boolean verify();
} // Implement cash and credit-card payment methods
