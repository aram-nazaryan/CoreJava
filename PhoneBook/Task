Requirements:
Create a Console application that will represent PhoneBook. 
The program should read all records from a file (with predefined structure), sort them (with chosen criteria and ordering) and show sorted records in Console. After showing records it must show Validation messages for each line if there are nonvalid items.

On start the program should ask File Path (which should be relative, and the folder of files should be put in the project).
Find the files here:

File Path - {filePath}

Then after entering the file path the program needs to read all records from the file (which is with a predefined structure).


File Structure:
{name} {surname} {separator} {phoneNumber}
Edgar Danielyan - 0989598949
Hovhannes Shitikyan - 0988598949
Artak Hovhannisyan : 0925484988
Nara Hovhannisyan : 092548487

Validations for each line in the file:
Phone number should be with 9 Digits
The surname can be empty
The separator should be `:` or `-`.

After reading records from the file, it must sort the records with predefined ordering and with the following criteria and show them in the console.

Criteria:
First Name
Last Name
Phone Number Code (first 3 digits of Phone Number)

The order should be with following ways:
Ascending (0 to 9 or a - z)
Descending (9 to 0 or z-a)

If the selected criteria is "Surname", lines containing an empty surname should appear in the last rows.
Criteria and the ordering should be selected by the user before showing the records in the console.

“Please choose an ordering to sort: “Ascending” or “Descending”.
“Please choose criteria: “Name”, “Surname” or “PhoneNumberCode”.


After showing the sorted records, it must show Validation messages for each line’s non-valid item, also mentioning the line. 

Message structure:
Validations:
{line x}: {The message(s)}.
line 1: phone number should be with 9 digits, the separator should be `:` or `-`.
line 2: phone number should be 9 digits.
line 3: separator should be `:` or `-`.


Important Notes:
For Implementation, you need to use One Function for Sorting with Delegate Parameter 
Do not use Regex for this problem 
Example
File Structure: 
Sveta Danielyan @ 0989598949
Hovhannes Shitikyan - 0988598949
Ara Hovhannisyan @ 0547

Validation: 
line 1: phone number should be with 9 digits, the separator should be `:` or `-`.
line 2: phone number should be 9 digits.
line 3: phone number should be with 9 digits, the separator should be `:` or `-`.
